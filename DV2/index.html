        and what the immigrants are doing in Australia, this visualisation will explore, jobs, migration steams, age of migrants and which are the popular states to migrate to.

      <div id="vis2" class="viz donut"></div>
      <p class="note">Most new arrivals in 2023–24 entered via the Skill Stream with 72.2%. Then, family stream is second with 27.7% and the least common stream is the special eligibility stream with 0.01%.

      <h3>Top Occupations</h3>
      <div id="vis3" class="viz donut"></div>
      <p class="note">Registered nurses, accountants, software developers, and engineers dominate. This strong demand in healthcare, technology, and infrastructure sectors illustrates Australia's
        on going need of these professions as there are not enough locals who are doing these jobs.

      <p class="note">Mandarin, Arabic, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Punjabi, Italian, and Greek are among the top languages that were spoken at home other than English.

      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="note">
      <p>The area chart illustrates net migration trends across Australian states and territories from 2004 to 2023. 
        It highlights how migration fluctuated over time, with steady inflows until a dramatic decline around 2020, marked by the COVID-19 border closures. 
        This sharp dip reflects international travel restrictions and slowed population movement, followed by a strong rebound in 2022–2023 as borders reopened. 
        States such as New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland consistently attracted the highest number of migrants.

      </div>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="note">
      <p">The bar chart shows the distribution of migrants by age group, revealing that the 20–29 age group makes up the largest proportion of migrants to Australia. 
      This suggests that migration is driven primarily by young adults, likely for education and employment opportunities. 
      The number of migrants gradually declines with age, reflecting lower mobility among older age groups.
